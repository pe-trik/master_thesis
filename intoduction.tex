\section*{Thesis organization}
We settled on a less traditional strategy for the organization of this work: in every chapter we review the related work rather than in a standalone chapter. We review mutual related work in \cref{chap:theory} (such as neural network architectures or corpora).

Chapters progressively deal with problematic starting with Automatic Speech Recognition in \cref{chapter:asr}, further enhancing ASR in \cref{chap:enhanced_asr}, continuing with Spoken Language Translation in \cref{chap:slt}. Adaptation to speaker is described in \cref{chap:adaptation}. We also deal with ``bringing our work to life'' in \cref{chap:onlinezation}. Finally, we conclude the work in \cref{chap:conclusion}.
